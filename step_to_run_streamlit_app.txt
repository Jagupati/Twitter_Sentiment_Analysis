textblob 
wordcloud
pandas
streamlit
re
matplotlib.pyplot
plotly.express
PIL
seaborn
langid
langdetect
nltk
datetime

step1:-

	pip install pipenv 
	pipenv install streamlit pandas
	pip install -r requrements.txt
	pipenv shell

Step 2: Import all libraries mention in requriment.txt file
Step 3: Save streamlit code as app.py file.

Step 4: To run streamlit simply on terminal change directory to file location then type command streamlit run app.py  and press enter OR 	in terminal on existing location enter streamlit run full_path_of_file_location/app.py and press enter. It will generate an URL and 	move to browser. In Browser we see localhost_no. and app UI interface.


 


**************************Here are some steps you can try to resolve if any issue facing***********************************************

issue 1)	The error message suggests that the locking process has failed due to a resolution failure. This could be caused by a mismatch 		in sub-dependencies, which can often occur when different packages require different versions of the same package.

Solution:-	Check your pipenv version and make sure it's up to date with the latest version.
		Run the command pipenv lock --pre to install any pre-release dependencies that may be causing the issue.
		Run the command pipenv clean to remove any cached dependencies.
		Run the command pipenv install --skip-lock to bypass the locking mechanism and install the packages without locking them.
		Run the command pipenv graph to inspect the dependencies and their versions to help identify any mismatches.

Issue&Solution2) If none of the above steps work, try creating a new virtual environment and installing the packages again. This can often 			solve issues caused by conflicting dependencies in the current environment.

Issue&Solution 3)If there is a scrapperexception error, try updating snscrape(if snscrape  is not upto date then uninstall and install updated 		version of  snscrape And run streamlit App again following above step).

Issue in requrement.txt run dependencies library without version mention example:-if there is library like altair==4.1.0 not supporting then (pip install altair) only
